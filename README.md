# Aggrex.Ecosystem

Aggrex is an ambitious effort to provide an ecosystem of tools used to build blockchain technologies. These technologies may include wallets, client nodes, testnet ecosystems, block explorers, etc. Despite the growing number of blockchain implementations that exist today, they all are made up of the same basic parts. Aggrex should be thought of as a set of tools + coding practices that facilitate blockchain development.
