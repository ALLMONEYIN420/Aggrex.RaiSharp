RaiSharp
---------

An implementation of the [RaiBlocks](http://raiblocks.net/) protocol.

Overview
---------

RaiBlocks is a decentralized, zero-fee, near instantaneous means of transfering value. The original c++ implementation of a full RaiBlocks node can be found [here](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks). The goal of this project is to create an alternative implementation of the full node using .NET Core.

We follow the same philosophy of the RaiBlocks project: do one thing and do it well.

Milestones
----------

  * RaiSharp Node
    * UInt data types
    * Store blocks
    * Rebroadcast & validate blocks
